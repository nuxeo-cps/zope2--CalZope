- Many user interface improvements:
  - Everything is much prettier.
  - The month is displayed as text in the breadcrumbs and not just a number.
  - The pending/organized event are now shown on all calendar views.
  - Week views now have the calendar title as page title (instead of "week").
  - The javascript drop down now has monday as first day of the week 
    independant of locale. This is to be consistent with CalZope.
- Major rewrite of the navigation:
  - It now uses tabs to switch between year/month/week/day views.
  - It remembers the last selected date, so you can switch back and forth
    between day/week/month and year view without changing the date shown.
  - The calendar will now redirect to the last viewed view and the last 
    viewed date (when you create an event, the start date is seen as the new
    last viewed date).
  - A calendar drop down to quickly navigate to a specific date.
Bug fixes:

- Changed the orthography in French from "événement" to "évènement".

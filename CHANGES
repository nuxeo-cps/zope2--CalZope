Bug fixes:

- #1668: The jscalendars support for Portugese Brazilian didn't work.
- #1670: Bugs in event status display.
- the DivDateWidget actually generate datetime.date instances instead of
  datetime.datetime instance as previously (fixes a 'until' TypeError)
- #1718: When exporting as reader, private events was exported in full.
- the ical view does not export event that comes from other calendars
  (i.e. do not have it's main attendee as organizer) since ical client have
  already have the ability to subscribe to those calendars directly
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The js widget now uses ILanguageAvailability adapter if one exists to figure 
  out which languages are defined in the site.
- ZODB storage of events refactoring: event attributes are now natural unicode
  objects instead of latin9 strings: only the ical view ensure that the import
  utf8 does not have non latin9 friendly charaters
  There is also an upgrade method on the ZODBStorage for this.

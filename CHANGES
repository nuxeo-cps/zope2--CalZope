- The add and edit forms now check if any of the attendees of the event is 
  busy, and in that case, it you will get a form error status message.
  Also, when seraching for users in the attendee form, users who are busy
  are marked so. You can still invite them in that case.
  
  The "busy rules" are as follows: 
  
  1. An attendee is seen as busy if it has a non-blocking confirmed event
     which it has accepted. 

  2. If the attendee is somebody else than the current calendars attendee,
     and you are logged in as somebody who has Manage participation status 
     permission for the attendee, you will be allowed to double book.
     
  These rules are subject to change to whatever turns out to work best in
  practice. The feature should be seen as slightly experimental at the moment.
  
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Updated Spanish translation thanks to Jesús Martín.

- The WebDAV support previously incorrectly let you edit the calendar even
  if you only had the view permission. Now you need Edit Calendar.
  
  Note that some calendar clients, for example SunBird, will not tell you
  that the editing failed. Neither will they ask for a password, which means
  that if you open a calendar which is Anonymously readable, you will never
  be able to modify it, because Subnird will not ask you for a password,
  even though it received an Unauthorized error.
  
- 0004430: The error message "End must come after start" was untranslated.

- 0004429: Translation consistency. Always say "Add event", not "Create".

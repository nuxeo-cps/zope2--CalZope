- #1668: The jscalendars support for Portugese Brazilian didn't work.
- #1670: Bugs in event status display.
- the DivDateWidget actually generate datetime.date instances instead of
  datetime.datetime instance as previously (fixes a 'until' TypeError)
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The js widget now uses ILanguageAvailability adapter if one exists to figure 
  out which languages are defined in the site.
- ZODB storage of events refactoring: event attributes are now natural unicode
  objects instead of latin9 strings: only the ical view ensure that the import
  utf8 does not have non latin9 friendly charaters
  There is also an upgrade method on the ZODBStorage for this.

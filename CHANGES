New features:

- In the month view, the max events displayed per day is now limited to five.
  If you have more than that, only four are displayed, and a More... link
  appears linking you to the day-view.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed some french translations.
- Fixed bug on open ended recurrent event (s/expand/extend/).
- Fixed broken links for calendar info view.
- Main view redirect to last view now preserves portal_status_message.
- All the IDate objects now have a getCalendarUrl method, mainly used
  for actions in CMF that should only be done on the calendar.
- The getEvents with periods less than one day still had bugs in the handling
  of recurring events.
- The translation files are now compiled with --use-fuzzy, to include my
  guesses and dictionary lookups (better than nothing).

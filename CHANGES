Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- CalCore 2.1
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Many user interface improvements:
  - Everything is much prettier.
  - The month is displayed as text in the breadcrumbs and not just a number.
  - The pending/organized event are now shown on all calendar views.
  - Week views now have the calendar title as page title (instead of "week").
  - The javascript drop down now has monday as first day of the week 
    independant of locale. This is to be consistent with CalZope.
- Major rewrite of the navigation:
  - It now uses tabs to switch between year/month/week/day views.
  - It remembers the last selected date, so you can switch back and forth
    between day/week/month and year view without changing the date shown.
  - The calendar will now redirect to the last viewed view and the last 
    viewed date (when you create an event, the start date is seen as the new
    last viewed date).
  - A calendar drop down to quickly navigate to a specific date.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- #1668: The jscalendars support for Portugese Brazilian didn't work.
- #1670: Bugs in event status display.
- the DivDateWidget actually generate datetime.date instances instead of
  datetime.datetime instance as previously (fixes a 'until' TypeError)
- #1718: When exporting as reader, private events was exported in full.
- the ical view does not export event that comes from other calendars
  (i.e. do not have it's main attendee as organizer) since ical client have
  already have the ability to subscribe to those calendars directly
- #1719: The rights you have on an event is now extended with the rights
  you have on the attendees. This fixes a permission problem when 
  using calendars stacking.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The js widget now uses ILanguageAvailability adapter if one exists to figure 
  out which languages are defined in the site.
- ZODB storage of events refactoring: event attributes are now natural unicode
  objects instead of latin9 strings: only the ical view ensure that the import
  utf8 does not have non latin9 friendly charaters
  There is also an upgrade method on the ZODBStorage for this.
- Now uses events to handle indexing and similar.

Bug fixes

- Viewing calendars that didn't have a main attendee set cause an attribute 
  error when the calendar tried to calculate it's attendee.
- If you have the "Manage participation status" permission on a calendar
  (typically given via the AttendeeManager role) and you invite that calendar
  to a meeting, it will automatically accept the invitation.
- You can no longer double-book a calendar even if you are a manager

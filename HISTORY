** SVN URL: https://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/Zope2/CalZope/trunk Revision: 47849
Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Many user interface improvements:
  - Everything is much prettier.
  - The month is displayed as text in the breadcrumbs and not just a number.
  - The pending/organized event are now shown on all calendar views.
  - Week views now have the calendar title as page title (instead of "week").
  - The javascript drop down now has monday as first day of the week 
    independant of locale. This is to be consistent with CalZope.
- Major rewrite of the navigation:
  - It now uses tabs to switch between year/month/week/day views.
  - It remembers the last selected date, so you can switch back and forth
    between day/week/month and year view without changing the date shown.
  - The calendar will now redirect to the last viewed view and the last 
    viewed date (when you create an event, the start date is seen as the new
    last viewed date).
  - A calendar drop down to quickly navigate to a specific date.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
-
- Changed the orthography in French from "événement" to "évènement".

** SVN URL: https://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/Zope2/CalZope/trunk Revision: 47779
Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- CalCore 2.1
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- #1668: The jscalendars support for Portugese Brazilian didn't work.
- #1670: Bugs in event status display.
- the DivDateWidget actually generate datetime.date instances instead of
  datetime.datetime instance as previously (fixes a 'until' TypeError)
- #1718: When exporting as reader, private events was exported in full.
- the ical view does not export event that comes from other calendars
  (i.e. do not have it's main attendee as organizer) since ical client have
  already have the ability to subscribe to those calendars directly
- #1719: The rights you have on an event is now extended with the rights
  you have on the attendees. This fixes a permission problem when 
  using calendars stacking.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The js widget now uses ILanguageAvailability adapter if one exists to figure 
  out which languages are defined in the site.
- ZODB storage of events refactoring: event attributes are now natural unicode
  objects instead of latin9 strings: only the ical view ensure that the import
  utf8 does not have non latin9 friendly charaters
  There is also an upgrade method on the ZODBStorage for this.
- Now uses events to handle indexing and similar.

** CalZope V2.4.0 [R1 build 2006/05/19-13:23 by fermigier]
** SVN URL: https://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/Zope2/CalZope/trunk Revision: 45805
Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The add and edit forms now check if any of the attendees of the event is 
  busy, and in that case, it you will get a form error status message.
  Also, when seraching for users in the attendee form, users who are busy
  are marked so. You can still invite them in that case.
  
  The "busy rules" are as follows: 
  
  1. An attendee is seen as busy if it has a non-blocking confirmed event
     which it has accepted. 

  2. If the attendee is somebody else than the current calendars attendee,
     and you are logged in as somebody who has Manage participation status 
     permission for the attendee, you will be allowed to double book.
     
  These rules are subject to change to whatever turns out to work best in
  practice. The feature should be seen as slightly experimental at the moment.
  
- 0004431: The weeks are now displayed in the breadcrumb as "Week 20".

- #643/0004431: There is now a year-view, and a year-week view. 
  Also, the default view for the WeekList object redirects to the 
  calendar. This is useful if you have breadcrumbs, where the WeekList 
  object is clickable.

Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Updated Spanish translation thanks to Jesús Martín.

- The WebDAV support previously incorrectly let you edit the calendar even
  if you only had the view permission. Now you need Edit Calendar.
  
  Note that some calendar clients, for example SunBird, will not tell you
  that the editing failed. Neither will they ask for a password, which means
  that if you open a calendar which is Anonymously readable, you will never
  be able to modify it, because Subnird will not ask you for a password,
  even though it received an Unauthorized error.
  
- 0004430: The error message "End must come after start" was untranslated.

- 0004429: Translation consistency. Always say "Add event", not "Create".

- 0004431: The month-macro was missing a domain, so the "Week" label was not
           translated.

- When making a meeting the calendar which you are using must be an attendee.
  This was nowever not reflected either in the free time search result, nor was

  a participant, and you can not remove it.
- The langauge selection for the jscalendar widget has been improved.
- If you press the button to change the status in the list of events you
  participate in, you no longer get an error message.
- Various translation errors.
- The "Document" field is no longer displayed if here is no attached document.

Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Events you are not allowed to view (normally because they are private) are
  now a sober grey color, and not clickable.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Events that started and ended early was displayed incorrectly.
- Day views did not display any events at all, becuase of a CSS error.
- Editing of recurrence did not cause an "even changed" event, so notification
  and indexing was not properly done.
- Numerous translation fixes.
- The event list links was shown also for users that did not have the rights
  to view the pages.
- The jscalendar is translated into many languages, this is now used in the
  widget.
- The event list overview would not work if one of the events had an 
  attachement. You'd get an error on @@eventview.
- Five doesn't handle __bobo_traverse__ correctly, so if you have an object
  in the acquisition path that is a number between 1 and 31 or a year
  year, adding events to dates that contain these numbers would fail.
  The calendar now uses the Zope3 ITraversable interface instead of the Zope2
  __bobo_traverse__()
- The javascript popup for date selection now picks the correct translation
  (out of the available) if you have Localizer installed. Otherwise it picks
  english. The dependancy on Localizer will be removed when we get full i18n
  support in Five.

** SVN URL: https://svn.nuxeo.org/pub/CalZope/trunk Revision: 27427
Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- Old installations requires a reindexing of the database. This can be done
  by a python script calling context.portal_calendar.storage._storage.reindexAll()
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Searching the ZodbStorage for events is now significantly faster on 
  larger data sets.
- The links to current week or current month was removed.
- Events can now have different colour depending on if they are private,
  public or meetings.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Events that ended after the display time was often displayed incorrectly.
- Changing a participation status from the meeting lists caused an error.
- When using the meeting helper, the duration is now correctly reflected
  in the meeting creation form.
- Some missing translations fixed.
- The calendar edit form was made more readable.
- If you attached a document that would generate an error message when you
  rendered it, the event rendering would also fail. This is now fixed.
- The selected attendees in the meeting helper was actually ignored during
  meeting creation. This is now fixed by the new "addmeeting.html" view,
  that creates an event and invites the attendees selected in the helper.
- Trying to access attributes from withing ZPT restricted Python expressions
  didn't always work, becuase the claendars __bobo_traverse__ did not return
  the standard attributes. This seems to have only caused problems during unit
  testing, probably because the objects was not then patched by Five.
  
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The version of jscalendar was upgraded to 1.0.
- The new getAttendeeFromSpec() method was added.

  list of attendees to search for.
New internal features:

- #843: removed unused import.
- #848: The recurrence type selector now works on interfaces rather than 
  classes, which is cleaner and allows for overriding the recurrence objects.

Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All hours before and after business hours are now displayed only as one 
  hour, making the calendar use it's area more efficiently.
- There are now title attributes on the events, so that a "tooltip" pops up
  with more information.
- There is now a document field. This holds a text string which is supposed
  to be a path to a document. CPSSharedCalendar uses this is a more 
  detailed fashion with popup boxes containing navigation trees. CalZope 
  has no such fancy features, as it is assumed most implementations will 
  override this anyway.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Missing inputs in the meeting helper caused an error message, instead of
  missing input displays.
- The iCalendar import caused an exception, which now is removed.
- The pages for events now have proper permission checks, so that you now
  only can edit and delete events and manage attendees when you have the
  correct permissions.
- The month view now looks a bit less cluttered.
- Invalid input in datetime fields would cause an exception (#744).
- The event and and edit forms have received numerous cosmetic changes (#744).
- The add event form to and from fields defaults to "now" if no date or 
  week is selected. (Mantis 2937)
- Any event you had the right to view, could be reached through any calendar
  you have the right to view, even if the event did not show up in the 
  calendar itself. This made little sense, so now you get an error instead.
- The end widget now gives user feedback when the event end is before the start.

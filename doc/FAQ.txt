1. **Q:** How do I see a list of events that I need to act upon?

   **A:** On the main calendar screen, it should say prominently
   'there are n events that need action' (but only if there are
   any). There is a link to the more complete overview of all
   action-needed events, sorted by start date-time.

2. **Q:** How do I see the when, what, where, and who of the event?

   **A:** You go to the event detail screen, and you see the event
   title (what), date, time, duration (when), organizer (who), 
   then a summary (what), also the location (where).

   You also see your status, like 'action needed' or 'accepted'.

3. **Q:** How do I accept an event I've been invited for?

   **A:** In the overview screen, you see your event status
   (action needed, etc) behind each event in a drop down box. You
   can select 'accepted' there and press submit, changing your
   status of that event.

   Alternatively, on the event screen, you'll see your status too, 
   like 'action needed' in a drop down box. You can select 
   'accepted' there and submit.

4. **Q:** How do I find a list of events I've accepted?

   **A:** Also the main calendar screen, it says 'There are n events 
   you are planning to attend' (but only if any such events are planned 
   in the future). Clicking on it presents with a list of these events, 
   sorted by start date-time.

5. **Q:** How do I find out which events I'm organizing?

   **A:** On the main calendar screen, there is a prominent link
   'Events I'm organizing'. Clicking this brings you tot he
   'events I organize' overview. (done)

6. **Q:** How do I organize an event myself?

   **A:** On the main calendar screen, there is a link 'Meeting Helper'.  
   Clicking this brings you to a screen where you can invite people and
   book resources. To search for people and resources, you type in a part
   of their name in the search box and press search. If you type in an
   asterisk (*) you will get a list of all users and calendars. This can
   take a very long time on a big system, so it's better to type some text.
   After getting a list of persons and calendars, you can select which you
   want to invite. You can do as many of these searches and invites as you
   want. 
   
   When you have added everybody, you can enter the start and end times for
   which you want to look for free times. You can enter for example the
   24st of July 2007 to the 31st of July, between 14:00 and 17:00. A search
   for free time will then return a list of free times between 2p, and 5pm for
   these dates. You can then click on the time slot you want to use, and you
   will go to the event creation form. 
   
   When you have filled in the form and clicked "Add", all the persons and
   resources will be invited to your event, and if email notification has been
   set up, they will all receive an email notifying them about the meeting.
   
7. **Q:** How do I invite someone to an event I'm organizing?

   **A:** When viewing an event, you will have a link "Attendees".
   This link will bring you to the overview of persons and resources that
   attend the meeting. Here you can invite, remove and change the status of
   the attendees.

8. **Q:** I want to see the events in a particular date. How do I go there?

   **A:** There is a small calendar icon on every calendar screen.  
   Click this to get an calendar popup where you can select a
   date in the week where you want to go.
   
9. **Q:** What it the URL used for iCalendar access from for example
   Mozilla calendars or other WebDAV capable iCalendar clients?
   
   **A:** It's <path to calendar>/calendar.ics?disable_cookie_login__=1
   For example: http://www.nuxeo.com/members/john/calendar/calendar.ics?disable_cookie_login__=1
   
10. **Q:** What does the different event colours mean?

    **A:** The display of events is split up into five categories. Each
    category has a CSS class that can be used to control the color of the
    event. The rules for what category an event belongs to is as follows: If
    you don't have view access to the event, it is classed as an
    "Unauthorized" event (grey). If you have access, and the event has more
    than one attendee, it is classed as a meeting (light green). The other
    meetings are classified after their access setting: Public (light blue),
    private (light red) and confidential (white).

11. **Q:** What is the difference between Public, Private and Confidential
    events?
    
    **A:** Public is viewable by those who have the View public event
    permission on the calendar. This is usually those who have an
    AttendeeReader role on the calendar. Private and Confidential is viewable
    by those who have the View private event on the calendar. This is usually
    set by giving people the AttendeeManager role. There is no difference
    between private and confidential events, except their color.

12. **Q:** How come nobody has the View permission in the Calendars 
    permission management screen?
           
    **A:** By default the View permission is linked to the View calendar
    permission. This shows up like nobody has the permission in the ZMI
    interface. Normally you shouldn't need to change the permission mapping of
    the calendar. If you have permission problems, contact Nuxeo.

About
=====

CalZope is a Calendaring system for CPS and Zope 2, using the CalCore
calendaring library. It provides a user interface and a Zope event
storage and can easily be integrated into any Zope site.

To integrate CalZope into your Zope site, you need to create navigation,
mainly some sort of menu support. For this you may want to take a look
at CMFonFive and CPSSharedCalendar, who together do just this for 
CMF and CPS.


To set up a basic calendar
==========================

* Create an external method with the following information:
    Module Name: CalZope.install
    Method Name: install

* After you have created it, run it by clicking on its "Test" tab.
  This creates a folder called "calendars" in which you can create calendars.

* In the folder there is an external method called "create_home_calendar".
  Open it and run it by clicking the test tab.
  This creates a home calendar for the current user. The calendar will be 
  named <user>_cal, where <user> is the user_id.

* You can view the newly created calendar by going to the calendars URL.
  For example: http://localhost:8080/calendars/admin_cal/

* As pure Zope has no menu system, you have to type in the URLS of many
  pages. Here are some of them:
    edit.html              Edit the calendar
    +/addevent.html        Add an event
    meetinghelper.html     Creating events for several attendees.

  The same goes for event objects. Here are some event URLs:
    edit.html              Edit the event
    recurrence.html        Change the recurrence of the event

Have fun!
